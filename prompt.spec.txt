I need a new Mindicity API project called "data-enrich" with an API module "buildings". 
The module buildings should have a GET endpoint /buildings/list that retrieves data from a PostGIS table public.buildings like this:
CREATE TABLE public.buildings (
    id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    cadastral_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    municipality_code TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NULL,
    building_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    geom public.geometry(POINT, 4326) NULL,
    basic_data JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb NOT NULL,
    visible BOOLEAN DEFAULT true NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now() NULL,
    updated_by TEXT NULL
);

The endpoint must have filters on all text columns via query parameters, and a geospatial filter polygon in WKT format passed in querystring that returns buildings inside the polygon.
Also create at least two MCP tools: one for basic search and one for geospatial search.
For coding speed don't worry about testing and linting.
